Geant4 Installer for Linux
==========================

To install Geant4 automatically, just run this command in your terminal:

    bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/pc2468/Geant4/raw/main/geant4_install.sh)"

This script will:
- Install required dependencies
- Download Geant4 source
- Build and install Geant4
- Set up environment variables

If something breaks, try:
    sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/pc2468/Geant4/raw/main/geant4_install.sh)"

For advanced/manual setup, see:

Happy coding!
